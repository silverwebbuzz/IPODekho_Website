                            warranties and conditions, whether express, implied or statutory, including merchantability,
                            fitness for a particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, accuracy or non-infringement.
                            Company and its suppliers do not guarantee uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free

                        <h2>Limitation on Liability</h2>
                        <p>In accordance with the applicable law, Company and its suppliers shall not be liable to you
                            or any third party for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or

                            damages. Your access to and use of the App is at your own risk, and you are solely
                            responsible for any damage to your device or computer system, or loss of data resulting

                        <p>We will not be liable for any damages arising from or related to this agreement, except as

                            and you agree to this provision. However, some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or
                            exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
                            exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
